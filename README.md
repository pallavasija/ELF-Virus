# ELF-Virus
A very simple self replicating ELF virus that copies itself to another ELF file in the same directory. The payload of this virus is only to print "Hello I am a simple virus".


Please compile the C file using gcc, note the size of the compiled file and change the file size in 'virus.c' accordingly (line 29 and 46).
